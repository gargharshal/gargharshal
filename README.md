[Here](https://github.com/gargharshal/gargharshal/kaggle) are all my Machine learning projects.  

**Dog Breed Identification ‚Äì CNN**

[Project Link GitHub](https://github.com/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Dog%20Breed%20Indentification/Dog%20Breed%20Identification%20-%20My%20Version.ipynb) - If this doesn't render, use this link [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Dog%20Breed%20Indentification/Dog%20Breed%20Identification%20-%20My%20Version.ipynb) (view only)

- Used [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers) to create a dog breed identifier based on a single image given by the user image.
- I used **Transfer Learning** by using a **pretrained Keras model**.
- I trained every model on a small dataset to find the best chosen based on **accuracy** and
**parameter count**.
- I created **callbacks** to **create logs** and to prevent the model from
**overfitting**.
- The final model **NASNetMobile** was trained on the full dataset and saved as a ‚Äò.h5‚Äô file which was used to make **predictions.**

**Bulldozer Price Prediction - Random Forest Regression**

[Project Link GitHub](https://github.com/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Bluebook%20for%20Bulldozer/Blue%20Book%20for%20Bulldozers.ipynb) - If this doesn't render, use this link [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Bluebook%20for%20Bulldozer/Blue%20Book%20for%20Bulldozers.ipynb) (view only)

- Used [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers) to create a model predict bulldozer price.
- Given the data of previous sales prices of bulldozers, we are trying
to predict the sales price of the bulldozers which have similar
characteristics.
- The data was first analyzed to find **missing values** and the **most
important features.**
- Missing values were filled, and the data was made compatible for
modelling.
- **RandomForestRegressor** was chosen based on [Sklearn Algorithm
Cheat Sheet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)
- After hyperparameter tuning, the model was trained and tested.

**Heart Disease - Logistic Regression**

[Project Link GitHub](https://github.com/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Heart%20Disease/Heart%20Disease.ipynb) - If this doesn't render, use this link [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Heart%20Disease/Heart%20Disease.ipynb) (view only)

- Used [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) to predict if a person has heart disease or not.
- The data on Multiple models to find the best one based on **precision**, **recall**, **f1-score**
- Understanding the parameters involved and their importance using **histograms**, **scatter plots**,  **Confusion Matrix**.
- Using **Logistic Regrssion** as the final model, fine tunning hyper parameters with **RandomizedSearchCV** and then training the best model.
- Understanding the model performance using roc curve, classification_report, etc.

**Titanic - Random Forest Classifier**
[Project link GitHub](https://github.com/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Titanic/Titanic%20prediction.ipynb) - If this doesn't render, use this link [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gargharshal/Kaggle/blob/master/Titanic/Titanic%20prediction.ipynb) (view only)

- Used [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) build a **predictive model** that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive the titanic ship wrecks?‚Äù
- Understanding the **parameters** and **dataset**
- Filling the missing values **mean or median**
- Transforming the data using **OneHotEncoder** to feed into the **classifier**.
- Training multiple models with test data to find the best one and creating predictions using **LogisticRegression**.
